# Epilogue + Logback example

This is an example Clojure project demonstrating how to use Epilogue (logging front-end) with [Logback][] (logging back-end).

[Logback]: https://logback.qos.ch

It is using [Typeset.logback](https://github.com/b-social/typeset.logback) as the log formatter for Logback as it supports all of Epilogue's features and has excellent Clojure support.
